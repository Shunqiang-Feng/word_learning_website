            <h2>Basic Functions of the Website</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Learning New Words: You can learn new words in each chapter. If you input the correct answer, it will be marked as "Correct" and will not be studied again. If the answer is wrong, it will be marked as "Wrong," and you can review it later. Words without any input will remain as new words.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reviewing Words: You can review words marked as "Wrong." If you input the correct answer, it will be marked as "Correct"; otherwise, it will remain as "Wrong."
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resetting Learning Records: You can reset the learning records of specific chapters or all chapters in the ID management section located in the upper right corner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Account Management: Register, log in, change your password, etc. Additionally, in the future, there will be support for issues like forgotten passwords.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>How to Check Your Answers</h2>
        
            <p>
                Your input will be compared to the correct answer by ignoring case differences and removing special characters.
                It's worth mentioning that in actual exams, especially in reading fill-in-the-blank questions, 
                you should enter the correct case and punctuation to avoid mistakes.
                Additionally, some words, such as "center" and "centre," are generally accepted in any form in exams. 
                However, this website currently does not support multiple matching formats.
                Symbols like the dollar sign "$" will not match with the word "dollar" on this website.
                Due to these and other limitations, the exercises on this website should only be used for reference training. 
                I hope they are helpful to you.
