# IELTSLearn.online

Welcome to [IELTSLearn.online](https://ieltslearn.online), a comprehensive website designed to help you improve your English vocabulary, specifically tailored for the IELTS exam. The platform provides tools to enhance your learning experience with effective word learning and review features.

## Key Features

### 1. Learning New Words
- **Master new vocabulary:** Each chapter contains new words to learn.
- **Answer feedback:**
  - If your input is correct, the word will be marked as **Correct** and removed from your study list.
  - If incorrect, the word will be marked as **Wrong**, allowing you to review it later.
  - Words without any input will remain **New**.

### 2. Reviewing Words
- **Efficient word review:** You can focus on reviewing words marked as **Wrong**.
  - Once you answer correctly, the word will be marked as **Correct**.
  - Incorrect answers will keep the word marked as **Wrong**, ensuring more practice.

### 3. Resetting Learning Records
- **Customizable reset options:** You can reset your learning progress for specific chapters or even reset all chapters in the **ID management** section in the upper-right corner.

### 4. Account Management
- **User-friendly account controls:** Register, log in, and change your password easily.
- **Upcoming features:** Future support for forgotten passwords and additional account settings.

## Answer Checking System

The system checks your input based on the following criteria:
- **Case-insensitive comparison:** Uppercase or lowercase letters will not affect the correctness of your answers.
- **Removal of special characters:** Special characters like punctuation marks are ignored when comparing your input with the correct answer.

**Note:** While the website simplifies certain aspects, it's crucial to remember that in the actual IELTS exam, proper spelling, punctuation, and case are important, especially in reading fill-in-the-blank questions. For example, words like "center" and "centre" are generally accepted in any form in the exam, but this site may not recognize multiple variations. Special symbols like "$" will not match with the word "dollar" on this site.

Therefore, exercises on this website are designed for practice and **reference only**. We hope they assist you in your exam preparation.
